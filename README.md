The legends is a website for unblocked games at school. (Mainly made this website because teachers mostly block google sites.) You can play the website at school, or at home if you want.

  # Who made the legends?

The legends was created by a student in Middle School. He knows a lot of html, css, and JavaScript. (Can't reveal name because of district reasons)<br/><br/>
The website was made with Glitch, a website editor that is the owner's favorite.
